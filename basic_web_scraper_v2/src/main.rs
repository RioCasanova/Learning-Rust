    Purpose: 

        Build a better version of 'basic_web_scraper' that uses less binary code
        and is more intuitive. Meaning that it should be easier to use, and 
        easier to know how to code it from memory.

        The overall purpose is to build Rust experience and skills as
        well as familiarity with async programming and other crates.
